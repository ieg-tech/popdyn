*Population Dynamics Modelling toolset*

The popdyn module is comprised of four main components:

1.  **Species** - which possess individual traits
2.  **Parameters** - which affect species through various means
3.  **Domain** - which defines a study area through spatial discretization
4.  **Solvers** - which provides modular numerical solvers to compute systems of species and parameters within a domain

Popdyn allows multiple species to reproduce, die, move around the landscape, and interact with one another
